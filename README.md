# i don't got no type

Heyo, this is "i don't got no type" - a super small project I made because my wisdom teeth removal made it much harder to do anything else. It's a very simple typing game that has rap lyrics as the words you're typing out. As it functions right now, it's a very rough project, and is nowhere near a final product.

In the future, I'd like to add a timer, a censor option (there's one specific word that I don't like typing out!), and maybe some more innovative features. We'll see if any of those come to fruition!

I include a small (semi-not-useful) script in `format` that can take Genius song lyrics and generally format them in a way that the web app can handle. All of that information is parsed and stored in `data.json`.

I built this with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## setup

In order to run this locally, you just need to clone the repo, `npm install`, and `npm start`:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/malsf21/i-dont-got-no-type
$ cd i-dont-got-no-type
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
